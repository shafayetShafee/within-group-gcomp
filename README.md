## Reproducing the study findings using Docker

**Prerequisite:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system.

**Steps:**

1. Pull and run the container using the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true --restart unless-stopped \
      --name within-group-gcomp ghcr.io/shafayetshafee/within-group-gcomp:latest
   ```

   > This image includes the correct R version, RStudio Server, MICS raw survey data
   (children and women modules), and all R package dependencies exactly as used in
   the analysis.

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8787`.

3. You will be connected to an RStudio Server session with the project pre-loaded
   and all dependencies installed. Run the simulation and analysis scripts directly
   from within RStudio Server.

4. To stop the container when done:

   ```bash
   docker rm -f within-group-gcomp
   ```
